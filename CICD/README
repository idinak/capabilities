Continuous integration (CI): helps developers rapidly verify functionality and merge their code
changes back to a shared branch more frequently. Merged code changes are validated by automatically building the application and running different levels of automated testing—typically unit
and integration tests—to ensure the changes work. If testing discovers a conflict between new and existing code, CI makes it easier and faster to fix those bugs

With continuous integration, developers frequently commit to a shared repository using a version control system such as Git. Prior to each commit, developers may choose to run local unit tests on their code as an extra verification layer before integrating. A continuous integration service automatically builds and runs unit tests on the new code changes to immediately surface any errors.
